# Student Mental Health Dashboard

This project analyzes a survey dataset on student mental health to uncover insights into how academic stress, sleep duration, GPA, and access to support systems affect student well-being and productivity.

The goal is to visualize key patterns, highlight at-risk groups, and communicate actionable insights through an interactive dashboard built in Power BI (or Tableau). This project is ideal for HR analysts, educational institutions, or wellness-focused research.

## Key Features:
- Cleaned and preprocessed mental health survey data using Python (Pandas)
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations
- Created an interactive dashboard showing:
  - Stress levels by GPA and sleep patterns
  - Support access vs mental well-being
  - Filterable views by gender, year, and residence status

## Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI (or Tableau)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control

## Dataset:
- Source: [Student Mental Health Survey Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahashfaqvirk/student-mental-health-survey)

## Outcome:
